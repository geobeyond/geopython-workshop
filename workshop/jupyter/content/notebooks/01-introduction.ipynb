    "<img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"images/geopython-logo.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With a low barrier to entry and large ecosystem of tools and libraries,\n",
    "[Python](https://python.org) is the lingua franca for geospatial development.\n",
    "Whether you are doing data acquisition, processing, publishing, integration or\n",
    "analysis, there is no shortage of solid Python tools to assist in your\n",
    "daily workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will provide an introduction to performing common GIS/geospatial\n",
    "tasks using Python geospatial tools such as OWSLib, Shapely, Fiona/Rasterio,\n",
    "and common geospatial libraries like GDAL, PROJ, pycsw, as well as other tools\n",
    "from the geopython toolchain. Manipulate vector/raster data using Shapely,\n",
    "Fiona and Rasterio. Publish data and metadata to OGC web services using\n",
    "pygeoapi, pygeometa, pycsw, and more. Visualize your data on a map using\n",
    "Jupyter and Folium. Plus a few extras in between!\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is provided using the Jupyter Notebook environment with Python 3.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Who doesn't like their data on a map right?  GIS software comes in many flavours and programming languages such\n",
    "as Java, C, JavaScript, Golang and many more.  So what's so special about Python for geospatial?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell: low barrier and fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely available: Python works on Windows, Mac, Linux and more\n",
    "* Minimal setup: the standard Python install provides significant functionality out of the box\n",
    "* Fast enough.  You can write a faster program in a lower level language but you can write programs faster in Python\n",
    "* Easy to read and understand\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cities = ['Toronto', 'Amsterdam', 'Athens']\n",
    "for city in cities:\n",
    "    print(city)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Easy to glue to core C/C++ tooling\n",
    "* Large ecosystem of supported packages ([Python Package Index [PyPI]](https://pypi.org), [GitHub](https://github.com), etc.)\n",
    "* Geo-friendly: Python has the widest and most supported geospatial software presence\n",
    "  * Python bindings of core tooling (GDAL, PROJ, GEOS)\n",
    "  * Flexible higher level packages (OWSLib)\n",
    "  * Servers (PyWPS, pygeoapi, pycsw, etc.)\n",
    "  * Support in traditional desktop GIS (QGIS, GRASS, Esri)\n",
    "  * Data science (GeoPandas)"
